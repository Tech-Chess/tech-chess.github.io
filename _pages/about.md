# Vision statement
We are a community of chess enthusiasts at MIT who enjoy one anotherâ€™s company and encourage others to join in the fun, promoting an atmosphere of lifelong learning!

# Mission statement
We serve the chess community at MIT through various programs, partnerships, and events, including casual community gatherings, guest lectures and exhibitions, a competitive national collegiate chess [team](/team), regular tournaments, and collaboration with local chess clubs.

# Story
For nearly two years before 2016, MIT lacked an active chess club, leaving many avid players stranded with no official organization to arrange meetings, tournaments, or lessons.  

In 2016, Tech Chess was born under the steady and enthusiastic [leadership](/officers) of MIT students Alexander Katz, Andy Trattner, Amir Cohen, and Jonah Butler. Our aim is to build a sustainable, awesome organization.

We hosted several successful events in the spring of 2016, including a chess tournament with just under one hundred participants, many of whom attend Harvard or MIT. Tech Chess has become a vibrant community that welcomes beginners and experts with spirited games and opportunities to improve their play.

# The Gameplan
