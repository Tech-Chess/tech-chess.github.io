Congratulations to our team "Massachusetts Institute of Tactics" for placing 4th of 325 teams at the US Amateur Team East this weekend! The team finished 5/6, losing only the final match to a team with multiple titled players. All the team members had truly fantastic individual performances in a very difficult field (including 11 grandmasters!):

Josué Velazquez (2.5/6 beating TWO international masters!)     
Oleksandr Shumaiev (3.5/6, including a draw against an international master!)     
Richard Yi (5/6)     
Zheng Yang “Zac” Sng (5.5/6!)

Our second team also performed admirably with a 3/6 score despite "only" a 1547 average rating (the max is 2200):

Sam Korsky (2.5/6)    
Brice Huang (4/6)     
Robert Kao (3/6)     
Daniel Wang (4/6)
