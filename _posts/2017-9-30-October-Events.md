# October Swiss

We will be running an unrated tournament with Friday rounds on October 6, 13, 20, 27. Players get 45 minutes per side (G45 d5), and clocks start at 5:30pm sharp in W20-208, Lobdell Dining in student center.

Entry fee is $5 by 11pm Thursday 10/5, or $10 by 5:15pm in person on Friday. Prizes are $30 - $20 - $10 based on 12 entries. Prize structure may be changed with many entries (might split into sections).

If you cannot make the scheduled time, you need to alert the chess club and your opponent 24 hours in advance (by Thursday 5pm). You will be allowed to play a make-up game with your opponent at a mutually agreeable time before the following Thursday. Players who fail to give adequate notice or reschedule promptly will be forfeited.


# Breakfast Club

Ever thought that college could be a great time to improve your chess, but you kinda failed to follow through with that?

We are starting a group which will meet twice weekly to work together on puzzles, analyze games, etc. The first meeting will likely be Tues October 3 at 8:45am. Please indicate your interest and preferences by noon Monday if you want to join.

# Casual Fridays

Due to popular request, meetings have been moved to Friday nights 5pm in W20-208. Pizza will be provided. Let us know if you prefer other times or locations. After tournament games end at 7pm, we will have casual group bughouse or blitz ladder if folks want to stick around.
