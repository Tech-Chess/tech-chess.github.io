# Introduction
## Until Now <!--- What led up to this document? Concisely --->
**"No matter what you study, MIT teaches you how to think."** I never truly understood this magical proposition, the testimony of countless alumni. It _almost_ makes sense. You study a lot, you learn how to digest and apply information, and you build scientific understanding of the world across multiple disciplines.

But what _is_ thinking? And what is thinking _better_? What does it look like concretely, and how do you improve at it?

I am lucky to have friends who challenge my ideas. They ask the right questions. They push me to reason deeper. With them, I want to hold myself to a high standard.

Perhaps in a less healthy way, MIT does the same. It makes me feel that excellence should be expected. And not much that I do is excellent enough. So I do more. I try harder. But I remain discontented. I endlessly question myself and the world. Was this the right activity, the right class? Did I make the right decision? The right friend?

After two years of this intense stress, I have discovered the secret of an MIT education: frameworks.

If you present a new idea or technology to an MIT professor, she will try to understand it...thoroughly. She might ask you for a one minute demo. She might request a blackboard diagram. She might bombard you with edge cases. She will probably do all three. It is amazing to watch brilliant minds efficiently probe and then wrap themselves around new concepts.

The key is to be watching. Take a look around. Take a look inside. Do you want to have this ability to absorb information and quickly manipulate it? To conclude and to predict with ease? To shape the old into the original? How can we learn any better than we already do?

To think well, one must communicate simply and thoroughly with others and herself. If you truly understand something, then you can explain it to a five year old child. But the MIT professor wants the details too. You have to ask yourself hard questions. You constantly refine your thought process.

The appropriate framework, or thought model, allows you to effectively satisfy the child, the professor, and the self. You can frame writing in terms of audience, purpose, channel, content, and context. You can frame entrepreneurship in terms of Bill's 24 Steps. You can frame the universe in terms of classical mechanics.

Frameworks have scope, but the scope can be unbounded. By creating or enhancing frameworks, we systematically build up understanding of ourselves and our world. Nobody at MIT ever tells you this, but science, engineering, the arts...literally everything is (or can be thought of as) part of some evolving framework. Defining and exploring the framework within a particular scope allows us to ask important questions like "what's next?" and make smart predictions. Thoreau once said, "something done well once, is something done forever."

The concept of the framework reveals the trick behind the magic of thinking. Perhaps you can find a better way of describing thought, but to me, the framework breaks down the nebulous concept of thinking into something concrete.

No matter what you study, as long as you are attentive, MIT teaches you how to framework.

## The Idea <!--- What is the central concept of this document? --->
What makes me happy? What am I passionate about? How can I cultivate a healthy lifestyle?

Let's build a framework for...life.

## This Document <!--- What is the intent of this document? --->
Life is hectic. I make lots of to-do lists and commitments, not all of which are healthy or feasible. I let myself experience stress to the point of physical harm. I don't regularly practice self-care.

I recently took an afternoon to myself, put pen to paper, and wrote out all of my current commitments and assets. I then wrote out my future obligations and goals. **img of commitments** I charted a timeline of the weeks left this summer then created criteria for "success." **img of success criteria**

This process involved a lot of instrospection. It was mentally and emotionally exhausting. But it helped me understand and express myself significantly better than I ever have before. I'm not sure if it was maturity or MIT, but I was so happy with my thoroughness that I questioned my ability to create this framework before age 20. Hence, the framework epiphany above!

I hope that writing out my framework here will
- help me internalize healthy lifestyle choices
- set a precedent of blogging to force reflection and idea refinement
- provide a useful example of framework building to others (and serve as a resource so I don't have to explain this ever again!).

This document
1. introduces frameworks (above)
2. outlines my recent framework for life happiness (next)
3. concludes with remarks on application (last).

Note that although Andy's summer life goals and needs are limited in scope, the three steps generalize easily. The following is essentially a framework within a framework. In general, you can sketch the situation, redefine success, and keep your virtue for myriad activities. Specifically, I used these steps as a framework to approach the creation of a framework for personal/relationship health and understanding, my framework for happiness.


# My Framework
## Sketch The Situation <!--- brainstorming organizing and then understanding/distilling/extracting key concepts/goals --->
At first, I had no idea what I was doing. I said, "Andy, let's sit down with a blank sheet and think about life." So I went to Hayden Library, sat in a corner of the second floor balcony, and stared at a piece of paper on a desk.

I had a million questions flying around in my head. Why was I unhappy with my time management? Which of the graduating seniors should I keep in touch with? What kind of food should I buy from the grocery store? Should I try to test out of biology, real analysis, or just practice chess over the summer?

The first step is to take stock and brainstorm what your framework is all about. In this case, it was about my life at the moment and trying to organize it. So I calmed my raging thought-storm and asked, "what do I have to do right now?" Then I asked, "what do I have going for me right now?" Then, "what will I need to do in the future?" I looked at some calendars and found that I effectively had 8.5 weeks left until the next phase of my life, fall semester. I asked, "what general things do I want to accomplish by that time?"

At this point, I felt ready to distill a few key concepts and goals. I tried to graphically convey the essence of the situation so I could better understand it and approach it productively. The result was my own version of Maslow's Hierarchy: an interplay between personal health, social/relationship health, and personal understanding all in the context of obligations and circumstances.

### To sketch the situation, you should
1. **Start** with a blank sheet
2. **Brainstorm** a bunch of thoughts to explore the situation and organize your brainstorming (_e.g._ categories)
3. **Extract** key concepts and goals to form a framework foundation to approach the situation.

## Redefine Success <!--- brainstorming then refining understanding of situation and criteria, structure of categories --->
Once I understood the details and high-level picture of the situation, I brainstormed criteria for success, including questions I wanted to answer and concepts I wanted to thoroughly explore. Going a level below the diagram and trying to create a specification for success helped to refine my understanding of the situation sketch.

Once success was loosely defined, I started to revise the metrics. I added new ones, organized categories, and consolidated overlapping areas. It can be useful to understand tradeoffs to estimate relative value in a number of sub-quantitative fields.

For example, try to answer the following question: how much do you value socializing? It is hard to answer this question immediately. You can make progress by defining an outing where you make three new friends and create a shared experience with two old ones. Is this worth four hours of sleep, or skipping lunch, or paying for an amusement park ticket? You can begin to quantify your subjective values in terms of tradeoffs.

In my case, the tradeoffs were having or not having answers to certain questions about each larger goal of personal health, relationship health, or personal understanding. I elaborated on what exactly I would like to have a solid answer to, and at what level of detail, in order for me to feel satisfied at having achieved the goal.

### To redefine success, you should
1. **Define** criteria for success in the situation through brainstorming
2. **Refine** the criteria with understanding of relative worth (tradeoffs) through further details
3. **Revise** the criteria and organize (_e.g._ categories).

## Keep Your Virtue <!--- what is the timeline and most important next steps, how to use the framework? --->
>If you can walk with crowds
>   and keep your Virtue
>Or walk with kings
>   nor lose the common touch...

It is amusing how one insight can lead to another. Only with my framework epiphany did I understand part of Kipling's "If" (excerpt above) that eluded me since MAP testing in the ninth grade.

Just like prototyping a product, only real use will provide the feedback necessary to polish your framework for production. You must have patience with yourself and the process as you go through the motions of creating and using a framework. With use, just like a yoyo or theorem, your framework will become more familiar, exciting, and adaptable to situations you never even imagined. Framework thinking is powerful.

You must embody the words of the poem. Channel fortitude, do not bend under social pressure, and remain calmly determined whenever possible. Reflect on what you have done without bias, and honestly give yourself feedback. Maintain integrity.

The most important and exciting step in creating a framework is to use it! I began by outlining a rough timeline to tackle each of my goals, subdividing the work into convenient tasks in alignment with the relative worth of each criterion, then documenting and reflecting on my understanding of the process and my progress, partially by writing this.

There is no substitute for time. You will always get more done if you spend 10 minutes every day planning your priorities and action items than if you try to automate a fancy to-do list or outsource your internal prioritization to a calendar notification. Being deliberate and truly internalizing and reflecting on your framework will enable a much more productive working relationship between you and it than any other setup. At least for me, I make the best progress when I dedicate my brain and body to a goal. I have tried lessening the effort these things need to use to achieve the same effect, but it is never worth it.

### To keep your virtue, you should
1. **Timeline** out the path to each goal
2. **Divide and Conquer** by listing and executing convenient subtasks to hit timeline milestones
3. **Internalize** the framework by documenting, organizing, reflecting, and revising deliberately.

# Conclusion <!--- Why/how is this framework useful? --->

## Breakthrough Moment <!--- Why is this so important? --->
Read the following excerpt from [Maciej Ceglowski](http://idlewords.com/about.htm)'s [remarks](http://idlewords.com/talks/sase_panel.htm) at the June 2016 SASE conference in Berkeley.

>The feeling of competence, control and delight in discovering a clever twist that solves a difficult problem is what makes being a computer programmer sometimes enjoyable.
>
>But as anyone who's worked with tech people knows, this intellectual background can also lead to arrogance. People who excel at software design become convinced that they have a unique ability to understand any kind of system at all, from first principles, without prior training, thanks to their superior powers of analysis. Success in the artificially constructed world of software design promotes a dangerous confidence.
>
>Today we are embarked on a great project to make computers a part of everyday life. As Marc Andreessen memorably frames it, "software is eating the world". And those of us writing the software expect to be greeted as liberators.
>
>Our intentions are simple and clear. First we will instrument, then we will analyze, then we will optimize. And you will thank us.
>
>But the real world is a stubborn place. It is complex in ways that resist abstraction and modeling. It notices and reacts to our attempts to affect it. Nor can we hope to examine it objectively from the outside, any more than we can step out of our own skin.
>
>The connected world we're building may resemble a computer system, but really it's just the regular old world from before, with a bunch of microphones and keyboards and flat screens sticking out of it. And it has the same old problems.
>
>Approaching the world as a software problem is a category error that has led us into some terrible habits of mind.

Why does this happen? Startups seek to disrupt. Students seek to destroy (political systems, fossil fuel industry, _etc._). They want build from the ground up. As Maciej mentions, "intentions are simple and clear." It is easy to take the software engineer's approach.

Of course, there are many benefits to such an approach, the same approach that is taught in the classroom. But even MIT sometimes fails to teach the proper contextual grounding that students need to understand this "stubborn place" and why trying to "step outside of our own skin" is so hopeless. If we cannot objectively evaluate the world, then how can we hope to think optimally, or even constructively at all?

Frameworks provide the basis for constructive thought. Robust frameworks of thought allow us to adapt to the model-resistant world as it changes since we have mechanisms to keep our virtue. If we properly define the scope of a framework, then that framework accounts for complexity and context.

If our current framework is failing, then we must reflect deliberately on its failure and start again. Not from scratch, but from a sketch of the situation.

But Andy, your framework idea is synonymous with good modeling practices! But Andy, frameworks sound just like abstraction! Hell, frameworks _are_ models! What's the deal?!

Call it what you will, and conceptualize it how you wish. If you understand the value of having a lens through which to view the world, and if you can efficiently process the interaction between time's passage and yours to draw conclusions, make decisions, and do your thing as a human bean, then I'm choosing to say that it sounds like you have your own framework!

And once you have yours, then you empathize with others who have theirs.

## Where Are We Going? <!--- What does this help me achieve? --->
My favorite authors tell their stories such that we jump into the text, wrap ourselves in the language, and explore the structure of the frameworks at play (_e.g._ author, character). Emerging, we finds ourselves (more specifically, our frameworks) changed.

When we experience _Ender's Game_ or we encounter Dillard's essays, we are embarking on a journey to explore new ways of thinking. Our purpose may be to entertain ourselves, but we also reflect on our frameworks. A favorite quote or anecdote might stick. We add new dimensions.

I like these subtle, organic approaches to framework remodeling because they engage my empathy without artifice or pretense. They compel rather than command. They ask my emotional self to pay attention, and it responds by growing. My intellectual self might get modified in the process, sometimes without its knowledge.

The other approach is to confront the intellectual self with a new framework and force the puzzle pieces of the old into prescribed slots. This tension makes it likely for the slots to burst. The old framework returns with a vengeance. It's counterproductive and frustrating to jar ourselves in this way.

The stories of others allow us to live deliberately. We take journeys and journeys take time. Unlike articles or self-help books, stories calmly massage our frameworks into health. They assist us in keeping our virtue.

A mentor recently said something to this effect: "I saw your passion, your mission, your story when we first spoke. I don't see any of that now." We were having a board meeting to review the progress of the startup I was working on, and I made the mistake of replying, "Well, this is a business presentation."

We ended up having a great discussion about storytelling. How the best business presentations need to be even more passionate and emotional. Through this experience, I changed my framework for understanding entrepreneurship. We love stories because we live them.
